People have been bewildered for many years when it comes to the large, pefectly round stone balls in CR. They range in size from tennis ball size to large enough  (almost 8 feet in diamter) not to be able to pick up. No one really knows how the balls came to be. Some think an alient race created them. Others think they have some sort of mystical origin. Scientists have still not been able to determine their origin.

One thing is clear; someone took a lot of time and care to chisel these balls in a perfect, sperical shape. However, the way they are strewn around with no apparent purpose, and the wide variety in sizing makes it difficult to figure out why they were made. Some locals have used explosives to break apart the balls expecting to find a prize inside. To their dismay, there wasn't anything of value inside.

According to [researchers](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100322143217.htm), about 300 of these stones exist. They weren't formally "discovered" until the early 19th century. Carbon dating proves that they were made around 600 A.D. Modern day scientists think they were made by using rudimentary hammers to break down rocks into circular shapes. In that sense, they are not anything supernatural at all. Rather, they were made by an ancient human culture for some sort of important purpose which is lost on us today. 

One interesting fact about these stones is that they were the basis for the opening scene in [Raiders of the Lost Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark) when Indiana Jones runs away from one. In any case, it is really interesting to see what ancient cultures were capable of when they really wanted to get something done!
