I came across a really interesting read about a small town in Argentina (Villa Epecuen) which spent over two decades under water due to flooded dam. 

The early 20's town was once a tourist haven for those seeking a break from the city life in Buenos Aires. The vacation town did well for itself during until the flooding in 1985.Apparently, there was enough water behind that dam to drown the town under 33 feet of water. Initially, residents tried to wait out the flood on rooftops. Soon, they found out the water was there to stay. The water didn't recede until 2009. 

The town now stands above ground, resembling something hit with a nuclear bomb.
